Okay so basically I did the pixy camera this year. I don't see why anyone would use this in future years but whatever I'll document it üëç.

To start it off you're going to want to download Pixymon and any drivers it wants you to get. 

Pixymon: https://pixycam.com/downloads-pixy2/

On that link you can also download the Arduino library. In 2017 we used I2C but those losers didn't document it. Arduino isn't the fastest way to go about 
vision processing but it is easy simple and it is kind of fun.
